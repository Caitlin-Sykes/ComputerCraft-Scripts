## Scripts Overview

1. **PotionBottler**:
    - **Description**: Attach this script to a create tunnel, have a pattern provider connected to a spout and fill out the variables. If it detects a bottling recipe being crafted, it will export glass bottles to the tunnel to be used in bottling. It will also emit a wired signal, similar to that in the PotionAutoBrewing script, where it can turn off the circuits when not in use.
